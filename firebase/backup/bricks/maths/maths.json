Thus the cardinality of a finite set is just the number of elements it contains.</p>  <p>For infinite sets, the notion of size first needs to be defined in a more rigorous and abstract manner. We do this by using the language of functions and saying that two sets are the same size if there is <i>bijection</i> (or one-one correspondence) between them. A bijection between sets A and B is a function that:</p>  <ul> <li>Maps every element of A to a different element of B (one-one)</li> <li>makes sure that every element of B has an element of A that is mapped to it (onto)</li> </ul>  <p>For example, by creating a bijection between <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(8).gif\" /> and <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(5).gif\" /> we can show that they have the same cardinality, even though <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(8).gif\" /> is a strict subset of <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(5).gif\" />.</p>  <p>It turns out with this definition that all <i>infinite</i> subsets of <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(5).gif\" /> are the same size, even though they may vary greatly in their composition. More surprisingly, <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(9).gif\" />, the set of rational numbers, is also the same size, even though intuitively it seems much bigger. Sets such as <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(8).gif\" />, <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(5).gif\" /> or <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(9).gif\" /> are said to be countably infinite and their cardinality is denoted by <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/Aleph0.svg\" width=\"15\" /> (Aleph null) - the lowest infinity</p>  When it comes to the set of all real numbers, however, the story is different. Cantor's diagonalization argument provides a proof that there is no bijection between the natural numbers and all real numbers. In this sense, <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(7).gif\" /> really is much bigger than <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(8).gif\" />, <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(5).gif\" /> and <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(9).gif\" />. The cardinality of <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(7).gif\" /> is denoted by <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(19).gif\" />. We can therefore write meaningfully that <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(19).gif\" />  >  <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/Aleph0.svg\" width=\"15\" />, even though both these numbers are infinite.</p><p>The <i>continuum hypothesis</i> asserts that there is nothing in between <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/Aleph0.svg\" width=\"15\" /> and <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(19).gif\" />. In other words, any subset of <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(7).gif\" /> must either be finite, the same size as <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(8).gif\" /> or the same sizes as <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(7).gif\" /> itself.
