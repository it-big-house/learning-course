An extremely cunning but relatively simple argument by <i>George Cantor</i> (referred to as his <i>diagonalization</i> argument) demonstrates that the cardinality of <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(7).gif\" /> is different from <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(8).gif\" />. To simplify the argument, we will consider only real numbers in the interval (0,1). If we can show that (0,1) is bigger than <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(8).gif\" />, then it follows that <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(7).gif\" /> must be bigger, too.</p>  <p>First suppose that there is a one-one function between the natural numbers and the real numbers in the interval [0,1]. It might look like this:</p> <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/q6_diag1.png\" /> <p>The numbers on the left are the natural numbers and those on the right are the decimal expansions of numbers in the interval (0,1) to which each natural number gets mapped by our function<sup>1</sup>.</p>  <p>The key part of the argument is that whatever the rule for this one-one function, it cannot be onto, in other words there <b>must</b> be some numbers in (0,1) that it misses. In fact it is relatively straightforward to construct one. In true mathematical fashion, we'll call this number <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(15).gif\" /> and will construct it digit by digit.</p>  <ul>     <li>The natural number 1 gets mapped to 0.192405... The first digit in the decimal expansion of this real number is 1, so we will make the first digit in the decimal expansion of <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(15).gif\" /> to be something different, say 2.</li>     <li>The natural number 2 gets mapped to 0.739287... The second digit of this real number is 3, so we will make the second digit of <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(15).gif\" /> to be something different, say 8.</li>     <li>The natural number 3 gets mapped to 0.001001... The third digit of this real number is 1, so we will let the third digit of <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(15).gif\" /> be something different, say 4.</li> </ul>  <p>So <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(15).gif\" /> = 0.284 ...</p>  <p>The point is that if we continue in this manner, we will have a real number that <b>cannot</b> be in in the list on the right. It can't be the first number, because it's first digit is not the same as the first number's digit. It can't be the second number, because it's second digit is not the same as the second number's digit, and so forth.</p>  <p>So there is a number that is not mapped to by an natural number on the left. Therefore the function is not onto and hence not a bijection.</p>  <p>So (0,1) and hence <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(7).gif\" /> are bigger than <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(8).gif\" />, <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(5).gif\" /> and <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(9).gif\" />.
