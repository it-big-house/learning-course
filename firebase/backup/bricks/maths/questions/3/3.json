In fact, we'll show they are the same size!</p>  <p>In order to do this, we need to have a rigorous way of comparing the size of sets, even when they are infinite. This requires the language of functions, with which you should be familiar.</p>  <p>Recall that a function is a mapping that is either many-one or one-one. We can illustrate functions between finite sets with mapping diagrams like the one below. This illustrates a function <img src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/scholar6/bricks/maths/CodeCogsEqn+(11).gif\" /> that maps elements from the set <i>A = {a,b,c,d}</i> to the set <i>B = {1,2,3,4}</i>.
