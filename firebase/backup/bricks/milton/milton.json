Even so, the formal limitation of the sonnet to fourteen lines denies Milton any riposte, and as we cannot hear his voice again, we may wonder whether his dismay and frustration has been wholly put to rest.

So rapacious and cruel is the returning master of this parable that some commentators have questioned the conventional interpretation that he represents the returning Christ. 20th century liberation theology insists Christ would never have likened himself to a tyrant who endorses money-lending. Milton’s unerring instinct for controversy allows him to exploit the difficulties of the parable in order to imagine a punitive, unreasonable God. The climactic question, “Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?” is brazenly sarcastic – Milton is close to implying that God is mocking him, and in doing so comes even closer to mocking God.</p>  <p>Yet this characterisation of a petty, vindictive God is both subjective and transient – we recognise, within the confessional framework, an element of self-projection, of Milton’s own grumpiness affecting his judgement. God is not to be circumscribed by one parable. Indeed, the second phase of the poem evades any allusion to Matthew 25, leaving our isolated, inconvenienced narrator to one side and rising to a scale of “thousands”, to sweeping views of “land and ocean” and a general impression of airy, intercontinental travel. God is above characterisation itself, though the choice of Patience as an envoy and the adjective “mild” (even if it attached to “yoke”) suggest a benign outlook, as does the sensible argument that the true nature of service is not for the servant to decide. Nor should it be overlooked that, even in his anguished octave, Milton is not wholly antagonistic: he writes of his soul being enthusiastically “bent to serve” his Maker and yearns to present his “true account”. Moreover, the phrase “Patience soon replies” reminds us that even if his anxieties are habitual, so too is his readiness to accept the arguments of Patience.</p>  <p>Perhaps, then, what tentative resistance the sonnet does offer is easily quashed. Milton himself chooses the word “murmur” to describe his discontent, deliberately playing down the idea of rebellion.

Milton is living in a new republic when he writes this poem. He disapproves of kings, especially kings with Catholic sympathies, so if his choice of the word is ironic we may wonder whether he intended the irony. Is God being presented as exemplary – behaving as kings should behave – or is he somewhat aloof and bossy? There is some reason to doubt the appeal of the God presented by Patience. He would seem to be busily “bidding” thousands to do his will, and though we are assured his yoke is mild, his agents appear to work “without rest”. Moreover, Patience argues that God has no need of “man’s work”. This is orthodox Protestant teaching (salvation is not through works but by grace alone) but undermines the logic of exhorting human service of any kind. Such conundrums are complicated rather than clarified by critics who insist that the “thousands” who “speed” around the globe must be the lower orders of angels, while the greatest angels, as Gabriel explains in Luke 1:19, get to “stand in the presence of God”.
