There is something radical about the image and characteristic of both Delacroix and Milton, for the looming winged figure, who must represent the angel Michael, is recast as a sinister, ungodly shadow.</p>  <p>So Delacroix’s Milton is still challenging convention, still seeing things differently. Indeed, the Civil War revolutionary is still dressed as a Puritan in stark black and white, an enemy to Popery and to the pomp and corruption of the restored Stuarts.</p>","type":"string"},"reveal":{"value":"","type":"string"}},"type":"object"},"name":{"value":"TextHighlighting","type":"string"}},"type":"object"}],"type":"array"}}
