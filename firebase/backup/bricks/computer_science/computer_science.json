In this brick we will be using 'square root' as a contrived hashing function in order to emulate more complex hash functions like SHA-1 or SHA-256, we will then put this into a merkle tree and finally try extending this into a delta compression chain. The goal is to see why we use this technology to detect changes to both decrease storage requirements and quickly detect changes in a file system or version history.","type":"string"},"summary":{"value":"","type":"string"},"pallet":{"value":{"_referencePath":{"segments":["pallets","demopallet"],"projectId":"learning-fortress","databaseId":"(default)"}},"type":"documentReference"},"subject":{"value":"Computer Science","type":"string"}}
